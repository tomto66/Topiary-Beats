Download and put the dll in your VST2 directory.  Possbily you'll need your host  to re-scan that directory.
Tested in Cantabile 3 - works fine
Tested in Cubase LE - loads fine but crashes Cubase when running

If the plugin does not work you may need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable from the link below.
