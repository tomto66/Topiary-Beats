# Topiary Beatz 0.8.5

Topiary Beatz is a plugin for beats & drums.

* Topiary Beatz folder contains the code and a projucer file
* Topiary folder contains code used by other Topiary modules; code is duplicated to make it easy for you :)

## Compile yourself

In order to compile, you will need JUCE and the VST2 headers. Steinberg no longer provides these but you can find them in the Juce 5.3 repositories.

Careful: binary data is provided in the Topiary/JuceLibraryCode folder - make sure your projucer doesn't delete that!

## Compatibility / Testing

* Tested/Compiled with Juce 5.3 / Visual Studio 2017 / VST2 / Windows10/X64
* Tested with no issues in Cantabile 3 and Cubase LE

## Installing binaries

* Plugin is found under Topiary Beats / binaries.  Feel free to rename it.
* Install in your VST2 plugin folder.  You host may need to rescan that folder.
