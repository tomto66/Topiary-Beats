# Topiary Beatz

Topiary Beats is a plugin for beats & drums.

## Compile yourself

In order to compile, you will need JUCE and the VST2 headers. Steinberg no longer provides these but you can find them in the Juce 5.3 repositories.

Careful: binary data is provided in the Topiary/JuceLibraryCode folder - make sure your producer doesn't delete that!
